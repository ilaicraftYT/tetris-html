# Tetris on HTML w/ JS

I asked my friend if we could make Tetris on Vanilla JS together. Surprisingly for me, he already recreated it long ago.

Turns out that I'm the only one in my friends group that never did Tetris as a beginner. Who blames me though? I started coding on C++.

Anyways, I made this so i could see if i can actually make a product over Tetris and if i it's even maintainable (nope), it has some bugs though:

* Z piece collision on bottom not working on the floor (board bottom).
* Pieces no-clipping if too much speed or hard drop is applied
* Rotating messes up collisions if did at last moment
* Hard dropping no-clips some pieces (causes unknown)

Tbh this is the first project that I ~~finish~~ am satisfied with.
